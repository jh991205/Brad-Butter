        <h1>Peanut Butter and Apple Layer Cake</h1>
        <p>September 14, 2019</p>

        <section>
          <p>When I was about ten years old, my brother and I would come home everyday to a snack. I remember always being so excited to get home so I could munch of something. But what excited me the most was that our daily snack would be something different every time. Sometimes it would be fried spring rolls or fried bananas, but one of my favorite snacks was something super simple: slices of apples with creamy peanut butter.</p>

          <p>There was something about the cold, crisp apples  paired and the smooth nutty spread that I couldn’t get over. For me, that combination is what chocolate & candy bars were to other kids. At the time, I thought I had discovered something ingenious and special to my family. Although I quickly learned that apple and peanut butter was nothing new (lol), I was glad that I could enjoy the novelty of such a simple snack during my younger days.</p>

          <p>This recipe is inspired by all the childhood memories, laughs, and smiles that came with eating apples with peanut butter. The combination is so timeless I don’t see how anyone who loves peanut butter and loves apples could deem it unworthy of enjoyment. Of course, to each their own, but I am happy to say that this is one of my favorite layer cakes. The peanut butter buttercream uses salted butter that pairs beautifully with the nuttiness of the icing and the natural fruitiness of the cake. Did I mention this cake happens to be vegan? Yup, miracles do exist. I found a vanilla cake recipe by Man About Cake on Youtube and fell in love with it’s simplicity. The oil keeps the cake super moist and helps keep my bank account in check as well. While you could definitely switch out the soy milk for regular milk, I say try this recipe as is just to surprise yourself a little bit. I certainly was baffled by how irresistible it was.</p>

          <p>Recipe is down below! Give it a try and let me know how you like it.</p>

            <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>6 sticks salted butter</li>

            <li>1 tbsp. vanilla extract</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>How to make</h2>
          <h3>For the Applesauce</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Quarter and core the apples and cut into medium-sized chunks (approximately 5cm thick all around).</li>
            <li>Place the cut apples, sugar, cinnamon stick in a large saucepot with 1/4 cup of water. Bring the apples to a simmer over medium heat. Cover and continue to cook until the apples give easily when prodded with a fork, about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Discard the cinnamon stick. Transfer the cooked apples to a food processor or high-speed blender and blend until smooth.</li>
            <li>Set aside to cool.</li>

            <li>Combine the flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl and mix to combine.</li>
            <li>Pour the vinegar into the soy milk and set aside for 5 minutes to curdle. Combine the vanilla extract with the vegetable oil.Once the soy milk has curdled, combine with the oil and vanilla mixture.</li>
            <li>Gradually add the liquid ingredients into the dry ingredients, mixing to incorporate. Once the mixture is free of lumps, divide the batter evenly between the parchment lined baking rounds. Bake for approximately 35-40 minutes, or until a cake tester inserted in the center of each cake comes out clean.</li>
            <li>Cool completely before icing.</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>For the Salted Peanut Butter Swiss Meringue Buttercream</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Combine the egg whites and sugar in a large mixing bowl. Place over a saucepot of simmering water and whisk until the egg whites reach 21C/70F and the sugar is completely dissolved.</li>
            <li>Remove the egg whites from the bain marie and whisk with an electric whisk until the meringue reaches stiff peaks.</li>
            <li>Add the salted butter 1 tbsp. at a time, making sure that the previous addition of butter is fully incorporated before adding the next.</li>
            <li>Once the buttercream has emulsified, add the peanut butter and vanilla extract. Mix until fully incorporated.</li>
          </ol>
