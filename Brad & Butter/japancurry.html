        <h1>Fall Japanese Curry</h1>
        <p>October 12, 2019</p>

        <section>
          <p>It’s finally fall break! With classes and most of my responsibilities on a halt, this break has been nothing short of relaxation aka cooking & baking all the things I know have time to cook & bake.</p>

          <p>Recently, I asked everyone what they wanted to see more of on Brad & Butter and one of the responses was more lifestyle content as well as my everyday eats & drinks. I loved the idea of sharing recipes that might be more accessible to everyone in terms of ingredients, complexity, and seasonality. Thus, this fall-inspired curry was born.</p>

          <p>Growing up, my grandmother used to make this delicious curry soup that I would indulge in week after week. The secret ingredient to her recipe was the one and only japanese golden curry roux cubes.  You can find these pre-made curry roux blocks in any asian grocery and they are packed with flavor. Of course, you can make your own with just butter, flour, curry powder, garam masala, and cayenne, but as a student I often don’t have the time to start from scratch. If you’re in a pinch for time, the pre-made stuff is more than magical.</p>

          <p>Japanese curry tends to be slightly sweeter than traditional southeast asian curries, which is why I have a soft spot for the variety. And if you haven’t noticed already, I’m a bit of a health geek — hence the butternut squash in place of potatoes in this dish. Sure, potatoes are awesome, but the butternut squash adds a natural sweetness along with the pears and honey that really complement the mild spice of the curry. I chose pork shoulder as the protein for my curry because pork is probably my favorite cut of meat. It’s relatively inexpensive, packed with flavor, and super easy to cook with. Feel free to substitute with any other cut of meat, but pork is prince. I would also highly suggest throwing some bones in the curry as it simmers so you can max out on depth of flavor, because nobody can say no to rich bone broth.</p>

          <p>Happy cooking and let me know what you think in the comments below!</p>
